title: GitHub Contributions

I started using Github to track progress on my PhD thesis. I have since then used it to collaborate on various projects,
both personal and professional.

I also try to contribute to open source projects when I can. Sometimes this is by raising issues, other times I have
contributed small features such as adding a sitemap endpoint in <https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3808>.
