Over the years I have gathered experience in a variety of technologies. My first exposure to programming was in high
school, where we learned the basics of `Delphi`.

In university I wrote all of my reports and theses with `LaTeX`. This isn't something people normally consider when they
think of programming, however it is [touring
complete](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Articles/LaTeX_is_More_Powerful_than_you_Think_-_Computing_the_Fibonacci_Numbers_and_Turing_Completeness).
It started my passion for code organisation and maintainability, something I still value a lot today.

During my post-graduate degree in chemistry, I pivoted my focus towards the field of computational chemistry. I learned
how to use `bash` and queueing systems like `slurm` to run large scale calculations on supercomputers. Later during my
PhD, I wrote [my first fully fledged program](/projects/phd-thesis) in `C++` which made me realise I wanted to pursue a
career in technology rather than science.

Nowadays, I mostly program in `Typescript`, but I have also worked with `Python`, `C#`, `Rust` and `Go`.
