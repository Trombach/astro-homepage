I have always been an enthusiast of technology. From building my first computer to writing my university reports in 
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), I have always been looking for ways to optimise and improve my workflows.

This passion for learning new technologies has stuck with me to this day and I have studied and used a variety of 
programming languages and frameworks.

My background in high-performance computing has also given me a solid understanding of computer hardware and linux 
administration.
