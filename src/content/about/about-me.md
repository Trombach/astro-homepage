title: About Me
---

I'm a PhD in theoretical chemistry with an interest in all things tech.
While working on my thesis I taught myself how to program in C++. Ever
since, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in technology and
software engineering.

My expertise lies in full-stack web development, but I also have some
experience in high-performance computing.
