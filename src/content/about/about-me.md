I'm a PhD in theoretical chemistry with an interest in all things tech. While working on my thesis I taught myself how
to program in C++. Ever since, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in technology and software engineering.

My favourite programming languages are Typescript and Rust and my favourite framework is Astro.

In my free time I like to code 🧑🏻‍💻, tinker with my NAS 🛠️, play my guitar 🎸 or go snowboarding 🏂.
