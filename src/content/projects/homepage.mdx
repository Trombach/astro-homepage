import Graph from "@components/Graph/Graph.svelte";

Welcome to my personal homepage! In this article you can learn about how this website was built, and what drove my
decision making.

## Quick Facts

- statically built pages with some dynamic routes utilising Vercel's ISR feature
- uses Astro's [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) and
  [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for content
- takes advantage of `ViewTransitions` API for smoother page transitions
- interactive and animated using Svelte transitions and CSS animations

## The Logo

The favicon image and logo originates from a figure I generated for one of my research papers during my PhD. It
represents the connectivity graph of an [Icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedron); it could be viewed as
a projection of a 3D Icosahedron in the 2D plane.

I always liked the aesthetics of this graph and when I came across Svelte's `draw` transition I knew it was the perfect
picture for trying it out.

Since I had already generated SVG files of the graph for my PhD thesis it was relatively easy to implement this
transition. When I created those SVGs I was obviously not thinking about their compatibility with Svelte's animation
library so I had to make some adjustments. The program I used to generate the graph images used doubled up strokes
instead of single ones. Next, I segmented the image into 6 distinct `path` elements, so that I could animate them
individually.

To enable the animation we only have to add `in` directives to the `path` elements and set the desired animation
options.

```svelte
<svg>
  ...
  <path
    in:draw={{ duration: 2500 }}
    out:fade={{ duration: 500 }}
    d="m 138.20133,96.169887 36.67167,-0.0021 -18.3441,45.885573 -48.88072,-28.2213 30.55424,-17.662998 18.32544,45.882238"
  />
</svg>
```

Svelte transitions get triggered when an element enters or leaves the DOM. The last remaining step is to wrap our SVG in
a conditional statement and set the condition to `true` when the component gets mounted with `onMount()`.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { onMount } from "svelte";

  let show = false;
  onMount(() => (show = true));
</script>

<svg>
  {#if show}
    <path ... />
    ...
  {/if}
</svg>
```

The final transition looks like this.

<figure>
  <div class="bg-slate-50 py-5 dark:bg-slate-950">
    <Graph client:visible />
  </div>
  <figcaption>

## Why Astro?

### SSG by Default

Astro is an opinionated open-source framework with the goal of building fast, static web pages. While it can be used to
dynamically render content server-side or client-side, its default behaviour is to render static HTML pages.

Astro also makes it very obvious which part of your code is run on the server and which part will be executed client
side. It uses a code fence (`---`) to mark an area at the top of the `.astro` file as the _component script_. This
section is only executed on the server and can be used to fetch remote data for the static or server-side render
process. To run JavaScript on the client side a `<script>` tag has to be added to the markup containing the code to be
executed.

All of these features make it very easy to build highly performant content-based websites, which is reflected by the
perfect Lighthouse score of this page.

### Astro Content Collections

Astro has strong support for rendering both Markdown and MDX files. It is even possible to completely skip `.astro`
files and just write `.md` and `.mdx` file in the pages directory to build a webpage. For more complex content
structures Astro offers content collections, which can contain a combination of 

I'm using content collections in many parts of this website, for example on the landing page and for projects. In fact,
this article is part of a collection!

### Framework Components

One of the most powerful features of Astro is the ability to use components written for other front-end frameworks such
as Svelte or Vue. This hands an unprecedented amount of flexibility to developers to mix and match framework components
and choose whichever framework is suited best to solve a particular problem. For example, I chose Svelte because of its
feature rich animation library, but was also able to add a single component built in React when I couldn't find a
suitable library for Astro or Svelte.

### View Transitions

## Why Svelte?

Svelte is one of my favourite front-end frameworks to work with. Besides the fact that it is blazingly fast, it also
comes with some great utility functions for building smooth animations.

<figure>
  <video autoplay loop muted>
    <source src="/hero-animation-short.webm" type="video/webm"></source>
    Your browser does not suppoert videos.
  </video>
  <figcaption>
    Animation on the landing page. Most animations are achieved with plain CSS
    transitions. The blur effect on the card content is created using Sveltes
    `transition` libraries. You can view this animation on the
    <a href="/">Hero page</a>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Svelte also features a powerful reactivity model that is very easy to use. While it would have been possible to build
reactive components with plain Astro code, Svelte brings some additional quality of life improvements to the table such
as stores and reactive statements.

To me Svelte and Astro are a perfect match, combining a powerful reactive framework with an easy-to-use and powerful
static-site generator.
