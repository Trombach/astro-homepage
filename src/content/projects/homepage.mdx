Welcome to my personal homepage! In this article you can learn about how this website was built, and what drove my
decision making.

## Built For Speed

Today, there is a plethora of front-end frameworks to choose from when building a personal website or blog. While 
researching options I came across the [Astro](https://astro.build) project, which immediately resonated with my goal of
building a lighting fast, content-driven, an mostly static website.

Astro is an opinionated open-source framework with the goal of building fast and cachable web pages. While it can be
used to dynamically render content server-side or client-side, its default behaviour is to render static HTML pages.
This simplifies prioritising loading speed and makes Astro one of the most capable and fastest static-site frameworks.

One of the most powerful features of Astro is the ability to use components written for other front-end frameworks such
as [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org). This hands an unprecedented amount of flexibility to developers to mix and match framework components
and choose whichever framework is suited best to solve a particular problem. For example, I chose Svelte because of its
feature rich animation library, but was also able to add a single component built in React when I couldn't find a
suitable library for Astro or Svelte.

## Animations

Animations are satisfying. They present a simple way to make a static page feel more alive and organic. I've 
experimented with various animation types on this homepage, which are explained in more detail in the following
sections.

<video width="100%" autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="/hero.webm" type="video/webm"></source>
  Your browser does not support videos.
</video>

### Scroll Based Animations

:::note[Browser Support]
The CSS feature `animation-timeline` is currently only supported in Chromium based browsers. Scroll-driven animations
won't work in Firefox or Safari. There is a [polyfill](https://github.com/flackr/scroll-timeline) to add
support to these browsers, but it has some limitations and I decided not to use it.
:::

There are many libraries to animate elements, when they enter the viewport. These usually rely on the 
`IntersectionObserver`-API and therefore require client-side JavaScript to be downloaded for the animations to work. One
of Astro's main selling points is, that it ships _0_ JavaScript by default and it therefore felt unnatural to me, to add
an animation library for this and lose one of the main advantages of the Astro framework.

The [`animation-timeline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timeline) property fills this gap 
perfectly (although browser support is not great at the moment). It's using normal CSS `@keyframe` definitions in 
combination with the `view()` or `scroll()` helpers and its usage should be quite familiar to people who have worked 
with CSS animations before.

<video width="100%" autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="/scroll.webm" type="video/webm"></source>
  Your browser does not support videos.
</video>

The slide-in animation of the text elements in the video above can be implemented with a few lines of CSS.

```css
.timeline-slide-in-bottom {
  animation-timeline: view();
  animation-range: entry 100% contain 25%;
  animation-name: slide-scale-in-bottom;
  animation-fill-mode: both;
}

@keyframes slide-scale-in-bottom {
  from {
    transform: translateY(100px);
    scale: 0.8;
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(0);
    scale: 1;
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

### View transitions

Astro generates multi-page applications (MPAs) by default. For each route a dedicated HTML page is generated and when
a user navigates to a new page the browser just serves the new document. This is great for performance, because
every individual page can be cached on the CDN. But it makes it more difficult to generate nice transitions between
elements, when a new page is loaded, which is fairly easy to achieve with single-page applications (SPAs). To fill this
feature gap, the [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API) has been
developed, which let's the developer mark elements with a `view-transition-name` and then the browser will generate
animations between elements with the same name across documents. Here is an example of what this looks like:

<video width="100%" autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="/vt.webm" type="video/webm"></source>
  Your browser does not support videos.
</video>

Only Chromium-based browsers support this API at the moment, however, Astro comes with a polyfill to make the 
transitions work in all browsers.

## The Logo

During my PhD, I worked a lot with graph representations of clusters. One very commonly found structural pattern is that
of the [Icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedron), one of the five Platonic solids. The image shown in the
favicon (and footer) is just a projection of this 3-dimensional structure in to the 2d plane called a graph. It allows 
for easy identification of the underlying connectivity (edges) of the vertices of the structure.

This graph picture was created for my PhD thesis and I noticed fairly quickly, that it would pose as a great candidate
for Svelte's SVG drawing library.

<figure>
  <Graph client:visible class="w-full max-w-[400px] mx-auto" />
  <figcaption>The connectivity graph of the Icosahedron. Animated with `svelte:draw`.</figcaption>
</figure>

To get this working, I had to separate the individually animated path sequences and make sure that they are represented
by a single line without any outlines. All that was left now was to use Svelte's draw function to draw in the individual
path segments with slightly delayed timings for a more organic feel.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
import { draw } from "svelte/transition";
import { onMount } from "svelte";

let show = false;
onMount(() => {
  show = true;
});
</script>

<svg>
  {#if show}
    <g>
      <path
        transition:draw={{ duration: 2500 }}
        d="m 138.20133,96.169887 36.67167,-0.0021 -18.3441,45.885573 -48.88072,-28.2213 30.55424,-17.662998 18.32544,45.882238"
      />
      <path
        transition:draw={{ delay: 150, duration: 2500 }}
        d="M 174.76114,96.115464 156.42349,64.357912 205.33361,57.301583 V 113.74417 L 174.75988,96.114924 205.33234,57.303514"
      />
    ...
    </g>
  {/if}
</svg>
```

Using the `onMount` function is necessary, because Svelte's transition directives only work when the markup gets 
inserted into the DOM. This works well in combination with Astro's `client:visible` directive, so that the component
starts animating when it first appears in the viewport. The full component can be found
[here](https://github.com/Trombach/astro-homepage/blob/46c6d4e4d58af77d062f4a47c1c89290f58e59e1/src/components/Graph/Graph.svelte).
