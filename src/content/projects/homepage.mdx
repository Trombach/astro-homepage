Welcome to my personal homepage! In this article you can learn about how this website was built, and what drove my
decision making.

## Built For Speed

Today, there are a plethora of front-end frameworks to choose from when deciding to build a personal website. While 
researching options I came across the [Astro](https://astro.build) project, which immediately resonated with my goal of
building a lighting fast, content-driven, an mostly static website.

Astro is an opinionated open-source framework with the goal of building fast and cachable web pages. While it can be
used to dynamically render content server-side or client-side, its default behaviour is to render static HTML pages.
This simplifies prioritising loading speed and makes Astro one of the most capable and fastest static-site frameworks.

One of the most powerful features of Astro is the ability to use components written for other front-end frameworks such
as [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org). This hands an unprecedented amount of flexibility to developers to mix and match framework components
and choose whichever framework is suited best to solve a particular problem. For example, I chose Svelte because of its
feature rich animation library, but was also able to add a single component built in React when I couldn't find a
suitable library for Astro or Svelte.

## Animations

### View transitions

### Scroll Based Animations

## About The Logo

During my PhD, I worked a lot with graph representations of clusters. One very commonly found structural pattern is that
of the [Icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedron), one of the five Platonic solids. The graph shown in The
footer is nothing but a projection of this 3-dimensional structure in to the 2d plane. It allows for easy identification
of the underlying connectivity (edges) of the vertices of the structure.

This graph picture was created for my PhD thesis and I noticed fairly quickly, that it would pose as a great candidate
for Svelte's SVG drawing library.

<figure class="w-1/2 mx-auto">
  <Graph client:visible />
  <figcaption>The connectivity graph of the Icosahedron. Animated with `svelte:draw`.</figcaption>
</figure>

To get this working, I had to separate the individually animated path sequences and make sure that they are represented
by a single line without any outlines. All that was left now was to use Svelte's draw function to draw in the individual
path segments with slightly delayed timings for a more organic feel.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
import { draw } from "svelte/transition";
import { onMount } from "svelte";

let show = false;
onMount(() => {
  show = true;
});
</script>

<svg>
  {#if show}
    <g>
      <path
        transition:draw={{ duration: 2500 }}
        d="m 138.20133,96.169887 36.67167,-0.0021 -18.3441,45.885573 -48.88072,-28.2213 30.55424,-17.662998 18.32544,45.882238"
      />
      <path
        transition:draw={{ delay: 150, duration: 2500 }}
        d="M 174.76114,96.115464 156.42349,64.357912 205.33361,57.301583 V 113.74417 L 174.75988,96.114924 205.33234,57.303514"
      />
    ...
    </g>
  {/if}
</svg>
```

Using the `onMount` function is necessary, because Svelte's transition directives only work when the markup gets 
inserted into the DOM. This works well in combination with Astro's `client:visible` directive, so that the component
starts animating when it first appears in the viewport. The full component can be found
[here](https://github.com/Trombach/astro-homepage/blob/46c6d4e4d58af77d062f4a47c1c89290f58e59e1/src/components/Graph/Graph.svelte).

## Why Svelte?

Svelte is one of my favourite front-end frameworks to work with. Besides the fact that it is blazingly fast, it also
comes with some great utility functions for building smooth animations.

<figure>

    <source src="/hero-animation-short.webm" type="video/webm"></source>
    Your browser does not suppoert videos.
  </video>
  <figcaption>
    Animation on the landing page. Most animations are achieved with plain CSS transitions. The blur effect on the card
    content is created using Sveltes `transition` libraries. You can view this animation on the <a href="/">Hero page</a>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Svelte also features a powerful reactivity model that is very easy to use. While it would have been possible to build
reactive components with plain Astro code, Svelte brings some additional quality of life improvements to the table such
as stores and reactive statements.

To me Svelte and Astro are a perfect match, combining a powerful reactive framework with an easy-to-use and powerful
static-site generator.
