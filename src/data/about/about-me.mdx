Former researcher of quantum chemistry with a PhD turned software engineer.

Open-source enthusiast and contributor.

Generalist programmer who loves to code. I mostly program in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), but I am 
also familiar with low-level languages such as [Golang](https://go.dev), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and 
[C++](https://cplusplus.com).

In my free time I like to code 🧑🏻‍💻, tinker with my NAS 🛠️, play my guitar 🎸 or go snowboarding 🏂.
